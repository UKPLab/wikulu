# Wikulu - Self-Organizing Wikis

Wikulu - Self-Organizing Wikis project at the UKP Lab employs the latest Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies to manage unstructured information, i.e. to structure the content in corporate Wikis.

The importance of web-based collaboration systems called Wikis has grown tremendously over the last years, e.g. Wikipedia, corporate wikis.
As the usability of a wiki is initially very high, the amount of content grows very fast.
A common drawback of wikis is however that the usability decreases with the increased content amount.
The Wikulu - Self-Organizing Wikis project at the UKP Lab employs the latest Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies to manage unstructured information, i.e. to structure the content in corporate Wikis.
The objective of the project is thus to implement intelligent approaches to assist the user while creating, editing, or searching content. Wikulu should relieve the user of manual information management, leaving more room for productive work.
Why is it called Wikulu?
Kukulu is Hawaiian for to organize!
