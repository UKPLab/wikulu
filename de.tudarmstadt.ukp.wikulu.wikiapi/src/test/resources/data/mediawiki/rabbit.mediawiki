'''Rabbits''' are small [[mammal]]s in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Leporidae]] of the order [[Lagomorpha]], found in several parts of the world. There are seven different [[genus|genera]] in the family [[taxonomy|classified]] as rabbits, including the [[European rabbit]] (''Oryctolagus cuniculus''), [[Cottontail rabbit]] (genus ''Sylvilagus''; 13 [[species]]), and the [[Amami rabbit]] (''Pentalagus furnessi'', [[endangered species]] on [[Amami Ōshima]], [[Japan]]). There are many other species of rabbit, and these, along with [[pika]]s and [[hare]]s, make up the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Lagomorpha]].

==Location and habitat==
{{Expand section|date=August 2009}}
The rabbit lives in many area around the world.  Rabbits live in groups called [[warren]]s in underground [[burrow]]s, or rabbit holes. <ref name="Habitats1">{{cite web|url=http://courses.ttu.edu/thomas/classpet/1998/rabbit1/new_page_2.htm|title=Rabbit Habitats|accessdate=2009-07-07}}</ref> More than half the rabbit population resides in [[North America]].<ref name="Habitats1" /> [[Meadow]]s, [[woods]], [[forest]]s, [[thicket]]s, and [[grassland]]s are areas in which rabbits live. <ref name="Habitats1" />

==Characteristics and anatomy==
{{Expand section|date=August 2009}}
===Cecal pellets===
Rabbits are [[hindgut]] digesters. This means that most of their digestion takes place in their [[large intestine]] and [[cecum]]. In rabbits, the cecum is about 10 times bigger than the stomach, and it, along with the large intestine, makes up roughly 40% of the rabbit's digestive tract.<ref>"Feeding the Pet Rabbit"</ref> [[Cecotropes]], sometimes called "night feces", come from the cecum and are high in [[mineral]]s, [[vitamin]]s and [[protein]]s that are necessary to the rabbit's health. Rabbits eat these to meet their nutritional requirements. This process allows rabbits to extract the necessary nutrients from their food.<ref>Dr. Byron de la Navarre's "Care of Rabbits" Susan A. Brown, DVM's "Overview of Common Rabbit Diseases: Diseases Related to Diet"</ref>

Rabbits have two sets of incisor teeth, one behind the other. Therefore they are often mistaken to be rodents.<ref>{{cite book|last = Brown|first = Louise|title = How to Care for Your Rabbit|publisher = [[Kingdom Books]]|year = 2001|isbn = 9781852791674|page=6}}</ref>

==Diet and eating habits==
Rabbits are [[herbivore]]s who feed by grazing on [[grass]], [[forb]]s, and leafy weeds. In consequence, their diet contains large amounts of cellulose, which is hard to digest.  Rabbits solve this problem by passing two distinct types of feces: hard droppings and soft black viscous pellets, the latter of which are immediately eaten. Rabbits [[coprophagia|reingest their own droppings]] (rather than [[Ruminant|chewing the cud]] as do cows and many other herbivores) to digest their food further and extract sufficient nutrients.<ref>[http://www.oaktreevet.co.uk/Pages/leaflets/rabbit%20general.htm Information for Rabbit Owners]</ref>

Rabbits graze heavily and rapidly for roughly the first half hour of a grazing period (usually in the late afternoon), followed by about half an hour of more selective feeding. In this time, the rabbit will also excrete many hard fecal pellets, being waste pellets that will not be reingested. If the environment is relatively non-threatening, the rabbit will remain outdoors for many hours, grazing at intervals. While out of the burrow, the rabbit will occasionally reingest its soft, partially digested pellets; this is rarely observed, since the pellets are reingested as they are produced. Reingestion is most common within the burrow between 8 o'clock in the morning and 5 o'clock in the evening, being carried out intermittently within that period. 

Hard pellets are made up of hay-like fragments of plant cuticle and stalk, being the final waste product after redigestion of soft pellets. These are only released outside the burrow and are not reingested. Soft pellets are usually produced several hours after grazing, after the hard pellets have all been excreted. They are made up of micro-organisms and undigested plant cell walls.

The chewed plant material collects in the large cecum, a secondary chamber between the large and small intestine containing large quantities of symbiotic bacteria that help with the digestion of cellulose and also produce certain B vitamins. The pellets are about 56% bacteria by dry weight, largely accounting for the pellets being 24.4% protein on average. These pellets remain intact for up to six hours in the stomach; the bacteria within continue to digest the plant carbohydrates. The soft feces form here and contain up to five times the vitamins of hard feces. After being excreted, they are eaten whole by the rabbit and redigested in a special part of the stomach. This double-digestion process enables rabbits to use nutrients that they may have missed during the first passage through the gut, and thus ensures that maximum nutrition is derived from the food they eat.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia | title = rabbit | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] | location = Chicago | edition = Standard Edition | date = 2007}}</ref> This process serves the same purpose within the rabbit as [[rumination]] does in cattle and sheep.<ref>''The Private Life of the Rabbit'', R. M. Lockley, 1964. Chapter 10.</ref> <!-- This reference is for the whole section, as written 30th July 2007 -->

==Behavior==
{{Cleanup-section|date=August 2009}}
[[Image:Rabbit side view.JPG|thumb|A rabbit's side view]]
Rabbits, being prey animals, tend to be exploratory in new spaces and when confronted with a threat, they tend to freeze and observe.

Rabbit vision has a remarkably wide field of view, and a good deal of it is devoted to overhead scanning.  Even indoors, rabbits will scan for overhead threats.

Rabbits have a complex social structure, and like dogs, will attempt to establish a hierarchy and dominance.
{{-}}

==Reproduction==
{{Expand section|date=August 2009}}
Does do not actually ovulate until after breeding.  Does have a bifurcated [[uterus]] and often, breeding can involve multiple acts that can result in multiple impregnations from different bucks.  Males are commonly sterile during the heat of summer months.  

A litter of rabbit kits can be as small as a single kit, ranging up to 12 or 13; however there have been litters as big as 18. The gestation period is 30–32 days.<ref>{{cite book|last = Brown|first = Louise|title = How to Care for Your Rabbit|publisher = [[Kingdom Books]]|year = 2001|isbn = 9781852791674|pages=28-29}}</ref>

==Differences from hares==
{{Main|Hare}}
Rabbits are clearly distinguished from hares in that rabbits are [[altricial]], having young that are born blind and hairless. In contrast, hares are generally born with hair and are able to see ([[precocial]]). All rabbits except the cottontail rabbit live underground in [[burrow]]s or warrens, while hares live in simple nests above the ground (as does the [[cottontail rabbit]]), and usually do not live in groups. Hares are generally larger than rabbits, with longer ears, and have black markings on their fur. Hares have not been [[domesticated]], while rabbits are often kept as house pets. In gardens, they are typically kept in [[hutch (animal cage)|hutches]] — small, wooden, house-like boxes — that protect the rabbits from the environment and predators.

==As pets==
{{Main|House rabbit}}
[[File:Whiterabbit86-300.jpg|thumb|Oryctolagus cuniculus]]
Pet rabbits kept indoors are referred to as [[house rabbit]]s. House rabbits typically have an indoor pen or cage and a rabbit-safe place to run and exercise, such as an exercise pen, living room or family room. Rabbits can be trained to use a litter box and some can learn to come when called. [[Domestic rabbit]]s that do not live indoors can also often serve as companions for their owners, typically living in an easily accessible hutch outside the home. Some pet rabbits live in outside hutches during the day for the benefit of fresh air and natural daylight and are brought inside at night.

Whether indoor or outdoor, pet rabbits' pens are often equipped with enrichment activities such as shelves, tunnels, balls, and other toys. Pet rabbits are often provided additional space in which to get exercise, simulating the open space a rabbit would traverse in the wild. Exercise pens or lawn pens are often used to provide a safe place for rabbits to run.

A pet rabbit's diet typically consists of unlimited [[Timothy hay]], a small amount of pellets, and a small portion of fresh vegetables.  

Rabbits are social animals. Rabbits as pets can find their companionship with a variety of creatures, including humans, other rabbits, [[guinea pig]]s, and sometimes even [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s. Rabbits do not make good pets for small children because they do not know how to stay quiet, calm, and gentle around rabbits. As prey animals, rabbits are alert, timid creatures that startle easily. They have fragile bones, especially in their backs, that require support on the belly and bottom when picked up. Children 10 years old and older usually have the maturity required to care for a rabbit.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The service and therapy animals organization [http://www.deltasociety.org/AnimalsHealthChildrenChildren.htm Delta Society] has used pet rabbits as therapy for adults and children since the 1970s.

[[File:Rabbit meat.jpg|thumb|right|Rabbits may be [[Animal slaughter|slaughtered]] commercially for their meat.]]

[[Leporidae|Leporids]] such as European rabbits and [[hare]]s are a food meat in Europe, South America, North America, some parts of the Middle East, and China, among other places.

Rabbit is still commonly sold in UK butchers and markets, although not frequently in supermarkets.  At farmers markets and the famous [[Borough Market]] in London, rabbits will be displayed dead and hanging unbutchered in the traditional style next to braces of [[pheasant]] and other small game. Rabbit meat was once commonly sold in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], the sellers of which giving the name to the [[rugby league]] team the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]], but quickly became unpopular after the disease [[myxomatosis]] was introduced in an attempt to wipe out the feral rabbit population (see also [[Rabbits in Australia]]).

When used for food, rabbits are both hunted and bred for meat. [[Trapping (Animal)|Snare]]s or [[gun]]s along with dogs are usually employed when catching wild rabbits for food. In many regions, rabbits are also bred for meat, a practice called [[cuniculture]]. Rabbits can then be killed by hitting the back of their heads, a practice from which the term ''[[rabbit punch]]'' is derived. Rabbit meat is a source of high quality protein.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Factsheets/Rabbit_from_Farm_to_Table/index.asp |title=Rabbit: From Farm to Table}}</ref>  It can be used in most ways chicken meat is used.  In fact, well-known chef [[Mark Bittman]] says that domesticated rabbit [[tastes like chicken]] because both are blank palettes upon which any desired flavors can be layered.<ref name="bittman">{{cite web|url=http://www.howtocookeverything.tv/htce/TakeOnTheRecipes/detail/recipeId-24.html|title=How to Cook Everything :: Braised Rabbit with Olives |date=2008|accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref> Rabbit meat is leaner than beef, pork, and chicken meat.  Rabbit products are generally labeled in three ways, the first being Fryer.  This is a young rabbit between 4.5 and 5 pounds and up to 9 weeks in age.<ref>[http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/alt-ag/rabbit.htm]North Dakota Dept. of Ag.</ref>  This type of meat is tender and fine grained.  The next product is a Roaster; they are usually over 5 pounds and up to 8 months in age.  The flesh is firm and coarse grained and less tender than a fryer.  Then there are giblets which include the liver and heart.  One of the most common types of rabbit to be bred for meat is [[New Zealand white rabbit]].

There are several health issues associated with the use of rabbits for meat, one of which is [[Tularemia]] or Rabbit Fever.<ref>[http://health.utah.gov/epi/fact_sheets/tularem.html Tularemia (Rabbit fever)]</ref> Another is so-called [[rabbit starvation]], due most likely to essential [[fatty acid]] deficiencies in rabbit meat and synthesis limitations in human beings.

Rabbits are a favorite food item of large pythons, such as Burmese pythons and reticulated pythons, both in the wild, as well as pet pythons.  A typical diet for example, for a pet Burmese python, is a rabbit once a week.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Rabbit [[pelt]]s are sometimes used in for clothing and accessories, such as scarves or hats. [[Angora rabbit]]s are bread for their [[angora wool|long, fine hair]], which can be sheared and harvested like [[sheep]] [[wool]]. Rabbits are very good producers of manure; additionally, their urine, being high in nitrogen, makes lemon trees very productive. Their milk may also be of great medicinal or nutritional benefit due to its high protein content.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Environmental problems==
[[Image:MyxoRabbit.JPG|thumb|A [[European Rabbit]] afflicted by [[Myxomatosis]] in [[England]]]]
{{See also|Rabbits in Australia}}
Rabbits have been a source of environmental problems when introduced into the wild by humans. As a result of their appetites, and the rate at which they breed, wild rabbit depredation can be problematic for agriculture. [[Gas]]sing, [[Rabbit-proof fence|barriers (fences)]], shooting, snaring, and [[ferret]]ing have been used to control rabbit populations, but the most effective measures are diseases such as [[myxomatosis]] (myxo or mixi, colloquially) and [[Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus|calicivirus]]. In Europe, where rabbits are farmed on a large scale, they are protected against myxomatosis and calicivirus with a genetically modified virus. The virus was developed in Spain, and is beneficial to rabbit farmers. If it were to make its way into wild populations in areas such as Australia, it could create a population boom, as those diseases are the most serious threats to rabbit survival. Rabbits in Australia are considered to be such a pest that land owners are legally obliged to control them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Classifications==
[[Image:jumpingRabbit.JPG|thumb|right|An [[Eastern Cottontail]].]]

==Naming==
Rabbits are often known affectionately by the pet name ''bunny'' or ''bunny rabbit'', especially when referring to young, domesticated rabbits. Originally, the word for an adult rabbit was ''coney '' or ''cony'', while ''rabbit'' referred only to the young animals. The word ''rabbit'', however, mostly replaced the older word during the 19th century after ''coney'' became a vulgarism by analogy to the word ''[[cunt]]'' (widely considered vulgar) due to their similar pronunciation. When coney was used to refer to rabbits, its pronunciation was changed to {{IPA-en|ˈkoʊni|}} (rhymes with "phoney"), from the original {{IPA|/ˈkʌni/}} (rhymes with "honey") because of this.<ref>Shipley, Joseph Twadell, ''The Origins of English Words: A Discursive Dictionary of Indo-European Roots'', JHU Press, 1984, p.129</ref><ref>Carney, Edward, ''A survey of English spelling'', Routledge, 1994, p.469</ref><ref>Morton, Mark, ''Cupboard Love: A Dictionary of Culinary Curiosities'', Insomniac Press, 2004, p.251</ref><ref>Allen & Burridge, ''Forbidden Words'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, p.242</ref> More recently, the term ''kit'' has been used to refer to a young rabbit. A group of young rabbits is referred to as a ''kindle''. Young hares are called ''leverets'', and this term is sometimes informally applied to any young rabbit. Male rabbits are called ''bucks'' and females ''does''. A group of rabbits or hares is often called a ''fluffle'' in parts of Northern [[Canada]].

==In culture and literature==
{{See also|List of fictional rabbits}}
[[Image:Ts'ui Po 001.jpg|thumb|''Rabbit and Acorn Jay Birds'', a [[Song Dynasty]] era painting by [[Chinese art]]ist [[Cui Bai]], painted in 1061 AD.]]
Rabbits are often used as a symbol of [[fertility]] or rebirth, and have long been associated with [[Spring (season)|spring]] and [[Easter]] as the [[Easter Bunny]].  The species' role as a prey animal also lends itself as a symbol of innocence, another Easter connotation. 

Additionally, rabbits are often used as symbols of playful [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], which also relates to the human perception of innocence, as well as its reputation as a prolific breeder.{{See|Playboy Bunny}} 

===Folklore and mythology===
The rabbit often appears in folklore as the [[trickster]] [[archetype]], as he uses his cunning to outwit his enemies.
*In [[Aztec mythology]], a pantheon of four hundred rabbit gods known as [[Centzon Totochtin]], led by [[Ometotchtli]] or Two Rabbit, represented fertility, parties, and drunkenness.
*In [[Central Africa]] "Kalulu" the rabbit is widely known as a tricky character, getting the better of bargains. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
*In [[Chinese literature]], rabbits accompany [[Chang'e (mythology)|Chang'e]] on the Moon. Also associated with the [[Chinese New Year]] (or [[Lunar New Year]]), [[Rabbit (zodiac)|rabbits]] are also one of the twelve celestial animals in the [[Chinese Zodiac]] for the [[Chinese calendar]]. It is interesting to note that the Vietnamese lunar new year replaced the rabbit with a cat in their calendar, as rabbits did not inhabit Vietnam.
*In the [[folklore of the United States]], a [[rabbit's foot]] is frequently carried as an [[amulet]], and is often used on [[keychain]]s, where it is thought to bring luck. The practice derives from the system of [[African-American]] [[magic (paranormal)|folk magic]] called ''[[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]].''
*In [[Culture of Japan|Japanese tradition]], rabbits live on the [[Moon]] where they make [[Mochi (food)|mochi]], the popular snack of mashed [[Glutinous rice|sticky rice]]. This comes from interpreting the pattern of dark patches on the moon as a rabbit standing on tiptoes on the left pounding on an [[usu]], a Japanese mortar (See also: [[Moon rabbit]]).
*In [[Jewish folklore]], rabbits (shfanim) are associated with cowardice.
*A [[Korea]]n myth similar to the Japanese counterpart presents rabbits living on the moon making rice cakes ([[Tteok]] in Korean).
*In [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Ojibwe]] mythology, [[Nanabozho]], or Great Rabbit, is an important deity related to the creation of the world.
*A [[Vietnam]]ese mythological story portrays the rabbit of innocence and youthfulness. The Gods of the myth are shown to be hunting and killing rabbits to show off their power.

On the [[Isle of Portland]] in Dorset, UK, the rabbit is said to be unlucky and speaking its name can cause upset with older residents. This is thought to date back to early times in the quarrying industry, where piles of extracted stone (not fit for sale) were built into tall rough walls (to save space) directly behind the working quarry face; the rabbit's natural tendency to burrow would weaken these "walls" and cause collapse, often resulting in injuries or even death.

The name rabbit is often substituted with words such as “long ears” or “underground mutton”, so as not to have to say the actual word and bring bad luck to oneself. It is said that a public house (on the island) can be cleared of people by calling out the word rabbit and while this was very true in the past, it has gradually become more fable than fact over the past 50 years.

===Other fictional rabbits===

{{Main|List of fictional rabbits}}

The rabbit as [[trickster]] appears in American popular culture; for example the [[Br'er Rabbit]] character from African-American folktales and [[Disney]] animation; and the [[Warner Bros.]] [[cartoon]] character [[Bugs Bunny]]. 

Anthropomorphized rabbits have appeared in a [[List of fictional rabbits|host of works]] of film, literature, and technology, notably the [[White Rabbit]] and the [[March Hare]] in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''; in the popular novel ''[[Watership Down]],'' by [[Richard Adams (author)|Richard Adams]] (which has also been made into a movie) and in [[Beatrix Potter]]'s [[Peter Rabbit]] stories.

===Urban legends===
{{Main|Rabbit test}}
It was commonly believed that [[pregnancy test]]s were based on the idea that a rabbit would die if injected with a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman's [[urine]]. This is not true. However, in the 1920s it was discovered that if the urine contained the [[human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]], a hormone found in the bodies of pregnant women, the rabbit would display ovarian changes. The rabbit would then be killed to have its [[ovaries]] inspected, but the death of the rabbit was not the indicator of the results. Later revisions of the [[Rabbit Test|test]] allowed technicians to inspect the ovaries without killing the animal. A similar test involved injecting [[Frogs in research|Xenopus frogs]] to make them lay eggs, but animal tests for pregnancy have been made obsolete by faster, cheaper, and simpler modern methods.
